## Welcome

Advanced Software Construction provides you with the experience and skills necessary to use a modern programming language in an advanced development environment to design, test, and build a large multi-user application. Your application will have a client frontend program that communicates, over the network, with a centralized backend server.

The content for this course is represented by the following parts.

- [Instruction](instruction/modules.md#readme) - Course topics
- [Chess](chess/chess.md#readme) - Instructions for building your application
- [Pet Shop](petshop/petshop.md) - Demonstration application
- **Canvas** - Submit assignments and tests 

## Course Schedule

Although assignment due dates are the same for all sections, the lecture schedule may vary by instructor.

- [Schedule for Professor Jensen's Sections](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/schedule/winter2024.md)
- [Schedule for Dr. Rodham's Sections](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/schedule/summer2024-rodham.md)
- [Schedule for Dr. Wilkerson's Sections](https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction/blob/main/schedule/spring2024-wilkerson.md)
 
## Outcomes

By the end of the course you should have experienced the following outcomes.

- Learn to construct a medium-scale server program with data persistence in a principled way by applying relevant engineering techniques such as up-front design, quality code construction, unit testing, assertions, and error handling.
- Learn and apply basic software design principles such as single responsibility, low coupling, avoidance of code duplication and information/data hiding to create modular code.
- Learn and apply the basics of relational database design, modeling and programmatic access.
- Learn and apply basic security principles and concepts.
- Learn to validate a programâ€™s behavior against its specification using testing practices.
- Use modern software tools including integrated development environments, testing frameworks, debuggers, version control, and documentation processing tools.
