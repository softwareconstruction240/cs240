Software design is the process of envisioning and creating the overall structure and organization of a program (or collection of programs). Fundamental to the design process is dividing a larger program or into smaller pieces (or modules), deciding what those modules should be, what each module will do, and how the modules will work together to achieve the functionality of the program. While the main goal is to create working software that satisfies customer needs, we also want to create code that is easy to understand, debug, and enhance, and that holds up well under change. While small programs can be successfully created without giving much thought to program structure, larger programs cannot. To create larger programs, one must give forethought to structure and organization, and apply good engineering principles that help create effective designs. This lecture discusses several important principles of effective software design.
