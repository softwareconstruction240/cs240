Relational databases are the most common way to persistently store and retrieve data. You can read and write data to a relational database from your program using standard library classes. Before we dive into how you actually use a database, we first want to discuss how relational databases work.

At a basic level, relational data is stored in a `database`. A database contains `tables`. A table has a number of `columns` that define the fields of the table. This can be things like `name`, `phone number`, or `id`. When you insert data into a database table it must match the column definition. Each data item is inserted as a `row`.

The following gives a simple visualization of a database name `pet-store` that contains a table for `pet`, `owner`, and `purchase`.

#### pet

|id|name|type|
|-|-|-|
|93|Fido|dog|
|14|Puddles|cat|
|77|Chip|bird|

#### owner

|id|name|phonenumber|
|-|-|-|
|81|Juan|6196663333|
|82|Bud|8018889999|

#### purchase

|id|ownerid|petid|
|-|-|-|
|51|81|93|
|51|82|77|

With you data stored in relational tables you can use the different ID fields of the table to cross-reference, or join, the data together to power your application. We will learn how to read, write, and query your data when we discuss Structure Query Language (SQL).
