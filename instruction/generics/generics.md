- Chapter 6: Generic Programming. _Only_ Sections 6.1-6.4

`Generic Programming` is a common programming language technique that is useful for strongly typed languages such as C++, C#, or Java. You can use generic programming to reuse class or function code that only differs by the type of variables they operate on.

For example, consider the standard JDK object `ArrayList<T>`. The `<T>` part of the class name refers to the `type parameter` for the class. When you create an object based on this class you specify what type you want the generic to use. This means you can create an `ArrayList` that only contains `String` objects or one that only contains `Integer` objects.

```java
var intList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
var stringList = new ArrayList<String>();

intList.add(3);
stringList.add("cow");

Integer integerItem = intList.get(0);
String stringItem = stringList.get(0);

```

If you attempt to put an integer into the stringList you will get a compile time error, and vice-versa. Also, because the compiler knows what its type parameter is bound to for the generic class, you don't need to do the type conversion.

Before generics were introduced to Java you had to either create a different class implementation for each type you wanted to support, or you had to use an `Object` to represent the type of the class and then typecast the `Object` before you could use it. Consider the following use of the non-generic `ArrayList` class.

```java
var list = new ArrayList();
list.add(3);
list.add("cow");

Integer integerItem = (Integer) list.get(0);
String stringItem = (String) list.get(0); // Exception thrown at runtime
```

Not only does this code force the overhead of type casting, it is also dangerous because your list can contain any type of object, and unless you use reflection, you have to guess how to type cast the object. If you guess wrong you will throw a runtime exception.

## Writing Your Own Generic Classes

You can also write your own generic classes by using the syntax that creates placeholders for the generic type. The following example creates a generic storage object that can be initialized to contain any specific type.

The example simply wraps an `ArrayList`, but it could be altered to read and write data to a database that supports different types.

```java
class Storage<T> {
    List<T> items = new ArrayList<>();

    void add(T item) {
        items.add(item);
    }

    T get(int i) {
        return items.get(i);
    }
}

var intStorage = new Storage<Integer>();
var stringStorage = new Storage<String>();
```
